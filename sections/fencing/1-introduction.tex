In many competitive sports, the analysis of video footage and numerical data can help gain an advantage in athletic performance. However, analysis requires not only specialized knowledge but also a great deal of time and effort. Therefore, it is very important to streamline and automate the process.

In recent years, advances in computer vision and machine learning have reduced the burden of these tasks in various fields. In this study, using such technology, we propose an analysis framework for extracting importanace information from video and numerical data to assist experts in their analysis work. 

Specifically, we will 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Create a panoramic image of the entire court from fencing footage captured by a Handycam
    \item Extract skeletal information of each athlete and their position on the court
    \item Examine methods for analyzing and visualizing matches and athletes using the skeletal and positional information.
\end{enumerate}

There are many people I must thank for contributing to my extended bachelor research experiance. First I must thank my adviser Kazuhiro Fukui who, through many disscussions has helped me finish this thesis. 
I would like to thank my close collaborators and lab mates from the computer vision lab who Iâ€™ve had the distinct pleasure of working with and learning from. 

I am thankful to the institutions and people who has made this research possible by permitting the use of necessary data. The single-leg jump data was provided by Shun Kunugi. The fencing data was provided by the Research Center for Medical and Health Data Science, The Institute of Statistical Mathematics, Research Organization of Information and Systems, and the Japan Fencing Association.
